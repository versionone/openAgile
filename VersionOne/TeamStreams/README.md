# openAgile Team Streams

As a result of working with Dave Laribee in July, 2014, we recognized the need to, at least temporarily, divide our backlog into two major streams:

## Team 1: openAgile Evolve

Purpose: TODO

Backlog owner: @aceybunch

Team charter: [openAgile Evolve Charter](https://github.com/versionone/openAgile/blob/master/Evolve/Charter.md)

## Team 2: openAgile Labs

Purpose: TODO

Backlog owner: @ibuchanan

Team charter: TODO

# Background

The older document [BigPicture.md](https://github.com/versionone/openAgile/blob/master/VersionOne/Artifacts/BigPicture.md) outlines the major factors that have led to this split. You can learn more about how we've progressed in the respective Charter links above. 

In brief, openAgile has been doing the following:

* Maintaining and upgrading around two dozen existing third-party integrations, most of which you can find with this [search for VersionOne.Integration](https://github.com/versionone?page=2&query=VersionOne.Integration)
* Responding to emergent request in GitHub, StackOverflow, ZenDesk, Google Groups, email, face-to-face requests
* Building new platform features to advance the state-of-the-art in integration capabilities, such as query.v1, OAuth2, and the nascent CommitStream
* Supporting internal DevOps efforts and producing open source tools and libaries under the [openAgile organization](http://www.github.com/openAgile) on GitHub
* TODO what else?


# Prototyping this change

We've met several times to prototype how this will work. Here are some sketches / diagrams:
