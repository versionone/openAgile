# openAgile Team Streams

As a result of working with Dave Laribee in July, 2014, we recognized the need to, at least temporarily, divide our backlog into two major streams:

## Team 1: openAgile Evolve

Purpose: TODO

Backlog owner: @aceybunch

Team charter: [openAgile Evolve Charter](https://github.com/versionone/openAgile/blob/master/Evolve/Charter.md)

## Team 2: openAgile Labs

Purpose: TODO

Backlog owner: @ibuchanan

Team charter: TODO

# Background

There are many factors which contribute to this split. You can learn more in the respective Charter links above. In brief, openAgile has been doing the following:

* Maintaining and upgrading around two dozen existing third-party integrations, most of which you can find with this [search for VersionOne.Integration](https://github.com/versionone?page=2&query=VersionOne.Integration)
* Responding to emergent request in GitHub, StackOverflow, ZenDesk, Google Groups, email, face-to-face requests
* Building new platform features to advance the state-of-the-art in integration capabilities, such as query.v1, OAuth2, and the nascent CommitStream
* Supporting internal DevOps efforts and producing open source tools and libaries under the [openAgile organization](http://www.github.com/openAgile) on GitHub
* TODO what else?


# Prototyping this change

We've met several times to prototype how this will work. Here are some sketches / diagrams:
