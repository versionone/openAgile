# openAgile Innovation Stream Strategy  

* Longer lived work
	* Harder to switch out
	* Deeper technical depth
	* Switching per iteration may not work
* Defines who and when switching can occur due to longer lived nature
* Kanban-stlye seems like a good fit
* Focus is invention for platform extension and usability


# openAgile Evolve Stream Strategy  

* Assign by iteration
	* Exception for longer items, based on estimation
	* Some issues take mote than one iteration
	* Let's be agile and adjust as needed based on
		* Estimates
		* Known work and availability
		* Expertise
		* Technical interest (opportunity to learn)
* Flexibility for allowing switching for growth
	* Urgency may dictate level of immediate expertise needed
	* Sharing knowledge as work is done is key (do not box folks into always doing the same thing)
	* Important to learn, increase technical depth
* Heavy test load
	* Automatation is key
	* Ensure integrations work with new versions of V1/target systems
	* Tester needs dev background (to write unit/integration tests)
* Internal/External evangelism
	* Increase adoption understanding of platform/integrations
	* Documentation, videos
* DevOps
	* Set up and maintenance of environments of target systems
	* Jenkins jobs for build/test of integrations
* Need well-defined and flexible roadmap, cannot do everything at once!
* Support
	* Zendesk
	* StackOveflow
	* Google Groups

# Questions:  

* How do we know who will or can switch streams?
* How will we know when switching is needed?
* How much support? Escalation only? How can we minimize?
* When does new platform/integrations become ready for evolution?
