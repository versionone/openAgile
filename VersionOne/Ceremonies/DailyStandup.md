# Summary (TL;DR)

The Daily Standup Meeting is a [brief meeting](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html) that lets us:

* Catch each other up on the progress we've made during the last day
* Identify any **impediments** we're facing that must be removed, and 
* Highlight what we plan to work on for the coming day (provided our **impediments** get removed!)
