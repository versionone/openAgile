# Summary (TL;DR)

The Daily Standup Meeting is a [brief meeting](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html) that lets us:

We use [our TeamRoom](https://www7.v1host.com/V1Production/TeamRoom.mvc/Show/354268), and generally follow the [Work Items Attend](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html#WorkItemsAttend) pattern, which helps in focusing through the items we set out to deliver for an iteration. However, as the pattern notes indicate this can lead to not everyone mentioning all important activities. The overall goal is to:

* Catch each other up on the progress we've made during the last day
* Identify any **impediments** we're facing that must be removed, and 
* Highlight what we plan to work on for the coming day (provided our **impediments** get removed!)

# Meeting Goals

* Utilizing [our TeamRoom](https://www7.v1host.com/V1Production/TeamRoom.mvc/Show/354268) as our tool, we start from the top and talk about the Stories currently in play:
* Briefly identify accomplishments during the last day
    * Call out any **impediments** that are blocking your progress
    * And, arrange to get help from others on removing the impediments
* Mention what you plan to accomplish in the coming day
    * If you feel you need assistance on it, ask
    * Likewise, if you feel you have important information for someone else, please share it
* Optionally:
    * Identify opportunities for improvement in the code, team process, etc
    * **Mention other cool stuff you learned!**
