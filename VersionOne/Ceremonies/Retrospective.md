# Retrospective

## Why? The Purpose of the Ceremony

Adapted from [Retrospectives.com](http://www.retrospectives.com):

> A retrospective is a ritual gathering of a community at the end of an iteration to review the events and learn from the experience. No one knows the whole story of the iteration. Each person has a piece of the story. The retrospective ritual is the collective telling of the story and mining the experience for wisdom.

* Focus on quality at all times.
* Identify recurrent, systemic problems so they are solved once and for all.
* Make everyone aware of the problem so anyone who can help, can contribute to fixing it.

## Who? The Participants

Whole openAgile team. Again, guidance from Retrospectives.com:

* Include everyone who has a piece of the story to tell.
* Schedule adequate time to tell the story. A rushed ritual will do more harm than good.
* Make sure there is a facilitator, someone who was not involved with the project, to lead the ritual.

*NOTE*: We are not currently following the third point. How might this affect our process? 

## When? Frequency and Timing

Second Wednesdays from 12:30 - 1:30

## How? The process

Because we have a distributed team, we gather virtually on GTM and open up the [RetrospectiveNotes] doc in Google docs, because Google docs allows collaborative, real-time edits by all team members.

* Load http://www.online-stopwatch.com/countdown-timer/ and set the countdown to 3 minutes.
* Then, we individually reflect on the previous retrospective by reading the notes for 2 minutes. **No verbal discussion is allowed at this time**.
* Next, reset Online-Stopwatch to 5 minutes, and individually type up 3 to 5 observations for the following question: 
    * **What did we do well and what did we learn, that if we donâ€™t discuss we might forget?**
* After the 5 minutes is up, we take turns pasting our notes into the Google doc and discuss them further with others if desired.
* Then, we repeat the process for this question:
    * **What should we do differently next time?**
* *When it's your turn to put your notes into the document, try to group your items with other like items that already exist.*
* Finally, reflecting on the assembled notes and conversation, we ask: 
    * **What is one thing we can, as a team, commit to improving during the next two weeks?**
* Save the Google doc, and change the openAgile channel topic to the team's agreed improvement goal.
