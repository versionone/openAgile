# Product Orientation

## Why? The Purpose of the Ceremony

The Product Orientation is a form of on-going [product chartering](http://agilesherpa.org/agile_coach/product_planning/chartering/). The purpose is to:

* Rebuild common understanding about a product that we are about to work on.
* Reconnect with stakeholders and customers about why this product exists.
* Refresh our knowledge about the problem the product solves and the value it provides.

This function is particularly important to us because we may not have touched a particular product as a team in a long time; some members of the team may be completely unfamiliar with the upcoming subject of our work.

## Who? The Participants

Team, stakeholders, and customers.

## When? Frequency and Timing

The meeting is called before starting a new product or when changing direction to work on a different product. We start with 1 hour of orientation and continue with 1 hour sessions as needed.

We switch no more frequently than every 4 weeks. This helps us:

* Manage switching costs
* Keep quality high
* Apply what we have learned from other work
* Pay down technical debt

## What? The Artifacts we Review and Update

* [Product Charter](../Artifacts/ProductCharter.md): Account for new understanding of our customers and their problems.
* Backlog: Shape existing GitHub issues into user stories and prioritize
* Demand sources: IdeaSpace, Zendesk, or other sources of input and feedback
* Assumptions and experiments
* Product Description and Demo Video

# Where? How We Get Together

* Determined as needed.
