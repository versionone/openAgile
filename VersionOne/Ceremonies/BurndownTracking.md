# Goal: Everyday we can see at a glance in the Burndown chart how much work we have remaining

We've identified that using Tests, instead of Tasks, will lead to a better way of thinking about the work and collaborating on getting working, demonstrable value for a given story.

However, we're already using Task successfully in some areas.

# Ideal world process

In the ideal world of the near future, we want to have a light-weight planning and estimation process that is continuous and collaborative:

* Progressively elaborate the Tests for a given Story within the Backlog
 * Some Tests may be defined when the Story is lower in the Backlog, 
 * Then, through Discovery work, as the item gets closer to the top of the Backlog, the Tests should be more and more well-defined and estimable, with little ambiguity.
  * **Note**: our backlog grooming process should be viewed this way. Grooming itself is a continuous process that often iterates over the same item to further refine it. We should not assume that we see the same item in grooming **only once**.
* Pull a story into Developing when the TEAM has capacity to do so:
 * Capacity defined, at minimum, as: a Developer, a PM, and Tester can agree to a Three Amigos and agree to support each other through the development of the story to get it to Passing / DONE.
 * The initial Three Amigos should further clarify the Tests, leading to the developer and tester being able to place a **Detail Estimate (hrs)** on the Test indiciating the amount of combined effort they think it will take to get the Test to pass.
* **Note on Tasks**: In order to reduce the number of tracking devices and mechanisms, if you idenfity work that, after trying to rack your brain, is still poorly expressible as a Test or just represents some work as a reminder / tracker, then still use the Test feature, but prefix the title with **"Task: "**  just to make it clear that's what it is.

# Practical evolution

In order to incrementally evolve to more of a "pull-based" workflow, without abandoning where Tasks make sense right now, how about this as a stepping stone:

## VP team

* Go to our [Team Room](https://www7.v1host.com/V1Production/TeamRoom.mvc/Show/354268) and look at the Testboard.
* Decide amongst yourselves how to split up the **Fix Broken Builds*** story's Tests.
* Then, for each Test click the "Sign Me Up" action so that its clear who is working to make that Test pass.
 * Edit the Test to put a **Detail Estimate (hrs)** value into it.
* Move the Test card from **Not Started** into **Developing**
  * Burn down hours on the Test until its time to move it to **Ready**, at which point it's ready for Ian to review and approve.
  
## Clarity Integration where Tasks already exist with estimates

Several of the stories here already have Tasks with estimates, so there doesn't seem to be any reason to shift this during this sprint. 

## Other items that only have Tests

For these, follow a similar process to above by signing yourself up and placing **Detail Estimate (hrs)** for the Test.
