# Long-Term Planning

## Why? The Purpose of the Ceremony

The Long-Term Planning is a form of on-going [roadmapping](http://www.enthiosys.com/agile-roadmaps/). The purpose is to:

* Consider upcoming, external events over the next 12 months and the market opportunities they provide.
* Look at how our work will fit with other efforts within the company.
* Explore synchronization points we might have with the VersionOne application. (Such as release of a new API to support an integration we build.)
* Speculate on the work we might do within the company's quarterly planning boundaries.
* Plan architectural work important for supporting foreseeable efforts.

The integration team is particular subject to disturbance by outside events such as new versions of integration targets. It is essential for us to look-ahead so we can be proactive and not just reactive. The Product Manager needs a realistic roadmap so he can prepare for [Product Orientation](ProductOrientation.md) in the next quarter.

## Who? The Participants

The Product Manager invites the team, stakeholders, and customers.

## When? Frequency and Timing

The Product Manager calls the meeting quarterly. We timebox the effort to 2 hours.

## What? The Artifacts we Review and Update

* openAgile Roadmap
* VersionOne Product Roadmap (from features on the openAgile Roadmap)
* Initial [Product Charters](../Artifacts/ProductCharter.md) for things on the roadmap

# Where? How We Get Together

* Determined as needed.
