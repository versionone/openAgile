f we want long running buckets with a rule for how to prioritize across them,
I would say they are: "Integrations" (where we take 1 at a time to update and improve),
"Platform" (things like App Catalog and Commit Service, that we take 1 at a time to update and improve),
and "Community" (which comes in from many channels, including Zendesk, Stack Overflow, Google Groups, GitHib, IdeaSpace, and Mindtouch; and must be serviced more "on-demand" than planned in iterations).
And my priorities would be: 1. Community, 2. Platform, and 3. Integrations.
