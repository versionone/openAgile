# The Big Picture (the problem in need of solution process)

There are **Three Major Buckets** in order of highest priority to Ian:

Ian's challenge:

>  We have multiple needs that need to be worked at the same time. Some is just what we've been doing on VS Client...How do I feed those queues and know they will all get worked?



## 1) Community

Our first priority is to enable other developers to build working software that works with the VersionOne application. Third parties may want to do all kinds of things like:

* Find specific information within VersionOne.
* Automate repetitive tasks.
* Measure concepts related to agile project management.
* Perform tasks in VersionOne from a client other than a web browser.
* Export data and charts as reports.
* Fit VersionOne into their existing toolchain.

The community expresses needs to us on many channels and we must be able to react to those needs "on-demand". In this sense, the community goal is more a service than it is a product.

### ZenDesk

* Community members submit support tickets here
* V1 Support Team and Developers answer tickets

### StackOverflow 

* Community members ask technical questions here
* Community members ask for alternatives and product comparisons from their peers here
* V1 Team, and community members, document technical "How-Tos" and link to code samples located in GitHub

### Google Groups

* Community members, and VersionOne employees, enage in threaded discussions

### GitHub

* V1 Team, and other community members, host open source code related to VersionOne here
* Community member can submit pull-requests to projects
* Community members can file issues against projects

### IdeaSpace

* Users submit ideas for product improvements, including for API and integrations

### Mindtouch

* V1 Team provides official VersionOne help and technical documentation here
* Ian creates glossary items of technical terms related to APIs and Platform



## 2) Platform

Platform is technology that enables the community. We build and improve tools like our APIs and SDKs to help developers be more productive with VersionOne. We build and improve tools like App Catalog to help our community engage with users.

In this area, we need to be mindful of the tension between building incrementally and keeping interfaces stable. Therefore, our planning practices reflect that interfaces take time to evolve into a stable platform. We focus on one domain at a time for development and improvement.

### App Catalog 

### Commit Service



## 3) Integrations

Ian states: *We take 1 at a time to update and improve.*
