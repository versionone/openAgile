# TeamRoom & Backlog Approach

* Scoped such that all work by our five devs (+1 to come) and 1 SEIT (+1 Agile Tester to come) are working on
  * Including any carryover Milestone work and Bluesun work
  * Including any new discovery or design work for Team Focus product
  * Question: what about the other boards for Sherpa and Matthew? Shouldn't we just combine these to one so that all Team-ish work discussed in one standup?
  * Question: what about WIP limits?
* Kanban
* Epic Swimlanes (don't overdue it!)
  * PMs attending standups on involvment-with-Epic/Story basis
  * With Stories made small enough that they include (or break down into smaller stories for):
    * UX designs
    * Data / Flow / API 
    * UX implementation
    * Manual / Exploratory Tests
    * Regression Automation
    * Community Site Documentation Updates

# Team Focus (Cakelike / Teamroom Like) Product 
* Create a Slack channel where people can chatter and share ideas
