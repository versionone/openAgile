# Product Charter

## Product Vision

We use the [formula](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/JimHighsmithonProductVisi.html) from Geoffrey Moore's book, [Crossing the Chasm](http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-Disruptive-Mainstream/dp/0060517123):

* For _target customer_
* Who _statement of the need or opportunity_
* The _product or project name_
* Is _a product category_
* That _key benefit, compelling reason to buy or use_
* Unlike _primary competitive alternative, current system, or current business process_,
* Our product _statement of primary differentiation and advantages of new product_.

## Product Opportunity Assessment

We combine Product Vision with the approach to [assessing product opportunities](http://www.svproduct.com/assessing-product-opportunities/) proposed by Marty Cagan:

* Target Market: For whom do we solve the problem?
  * Demand Indicators: How do we know there's a market for this? How can we find earlyvangelists?
  * Market Size: How big is the opportunity?
  * Competitive Landscape: What alternatives are out there?
  * Timing: Why now?
* Our Position: How will we get this product to market?
  * Success Factors: What factors are critical to success?
  * Differentiation: Why are we best suited to pursue this?
  * Measuring Success: How will we measure success/make money from this product?
