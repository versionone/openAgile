# openAgile Evolve

Evolve is an experiment that recognizes the work to evolve existing code bases is very different from the work to innovate new products. The experiment is to split the "on demand", maintenance, and incremental improvement work of openAgile into a separate workstream. We will run this experiment for 1 quarter to make sure we have sufficient time to inspect and adapt within the following constraints.

## Goal

Balance demand for keeping integrations valuable with the supply of developers who can do the work. Assume the demand will continue to increase. Help support the growth of demand through:
	* Education of external developers, thereby, satisfying demand with external supply.
	* Simplification of existing code, thereby, reducing the "cost" of satisfying demand.

## Values

* Enjoyment - Although it needs doing, we know maintenance is not enjoyable. Make a plan that allows everyone to do work they do enjoy. For example, maybe people have a rotation into the Evolve work stream so they can spend time on innovation too.
* Achievement - People need to be able to finish things and see an impact on customers. Make a plan that allows people to see whole things through to the end. For example, if rotating, maybe people stay for the duration of an epic.
* Understanding - People need to feel mastery in what they are doing. Make a plan that allows for adequate learning and research. For example, if rotating, maybe people stay for a matter of weeks, not just 1 day.

## Scope Priorities

1. Community - Respond to needs on community time, not our time frame. Respond to questions as they happen. Help with defects and code changes as they happen.
2. Platform - Fix and improve those things that are most common across projects (ours and customers). Supporting developers before end users.
3. Integrations - Help developers change and fix existing code. Help end-users get integrations working.

## Constraints for Working Agreements

* Make results visible. Small or large, we want to show off what we accomplish. Think demos and summary stats.
* Learn from our past. Every question and issue is opportunity for learning. Not just about what is broken and doesn't work but also what people need and value. Think how to broadcast and amplify that learning for everyone (V1 and beyond).
