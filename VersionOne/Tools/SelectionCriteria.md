# Selecting Tools for openAgile

* Supports our value of [openness](../Values/Openness.md). The best tools reduce barriers to contribution by avoiding unnecessary overhead such as:
  * User management that requires an administrator to approve people for entry-level access.
  * Heavy domain knowledge in the form of jargon or pre-emtive categorization (like required fields on bugs).
* Supports our value of [transparency](../Values/Transparency.md). The best tools make our intent and actions clear without unnecessary overhead such as:
  * Creating new user interfaces for information already inside the tool. For example, we don't like to create custom, read-only reports just to enable anonymous access to data.
* Supports our values of [meritocracy](../Values/Meritocracy.md). The best tools enable progressive levels of meaningful responsibility.
