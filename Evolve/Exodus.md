# openAgile Evolve Exodus Plan

An initial goal of the Evolve Team is to unlock legacy integrations from the internal Subversion repository, update and refactor them, then make them available in GitHub as open source solutions. To this end, the exodus will involve the following:

* Identify the integrations to be migrated and the integrations to be abandoned
* Review all current GitHub repos (what to keep, what to create, what to remove)
* Analyze the integrations for common dependencies
* Break out common dependencies into their own GitHub projects and if needed, make them available in NuGet/Maven
* Analyze and overhaul the Config Tool (may require work from openSprint Team -- Config.Service)
* Analyze and overhaul ServiceHost (refactor as V1 Integration Service?)
* Provide consistent documentation for integrations (mix of GitHub and Dev Community site?)
* Review and update AppCatalog entries
*
