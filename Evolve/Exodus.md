## Pre-Exodus Actions

Prior to moving integrations into their own GitHub repositories, there are a few actions that we will need to take:

1. Purge the [ServiceHost GitHub Repo](https://github.com/versionone/ServiceHost) of sunset integrations
2. Run the [VS Solution Dependency Visualizer](http://www.devio.at/index.php/vsslndepvis) to understand all dependencies
3.
