# openAgile Evolve Support Plan

As discussed in the [openAgile Evolve Charter](Chater.md), one area that the Evolve team will focus on is improving platform support. We'll start by defining a ticket lifecycle process that places emphasis on the 3Rs: Respond-Resolve-React.

## Ticket Lifecycle

The ticket lifecycle will be used primarily for handling tickets that we receive through Zendesk, but should be equally applied to other support related channels such as StackOverflow, Developer Google Group, email, or some other means.
