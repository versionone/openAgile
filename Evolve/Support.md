# openAgile Evolve Support Plan

As discussed in the [openAgile Evolve Charter](Chater.md), one area that the Evolve team will focus on is improving platform support. Platform support incidents include not only the [Zendesk openAgile](https://versiononesupport.zendesk.com/agent/#/filters/27801174) tickets, but also requests on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=newest&q=versionone), the [V1 Developers Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/versionone-dev), and emails that we may received from internal and external customers.

## Incident Lifecycle

The incident lifecycle will be used primarily for handling tickets that we receive through Zendesk, but will be equally applied to other support related channels such as StackOverflow, the V1 Developers Google Group, email, or other channels.
